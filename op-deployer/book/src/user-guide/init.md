# The Init Command

The `init` command is used to create a new intent and state file in the specified directory. This command is the
starting point of each new deployment.

The `init` command is used like this:

```shell
op-deployer init \
  --l1-chain-id <chain ID of your L1> \
  --l2-chain-ids <comman separated list of chain IDs for your L2s> \
  --outdir <directory to write the intent and state files> \
  --intent-type <standard/custom/standard-overrides>
```

You should then see the following files appear in your output directory:

```
outdir
├── intent.toml
└── state.json
```

The `intent.toml` file is where you specify the configuration for your deployment. The `state.json` file is where OP
Deployer will output the current state of the deployment after each [stage][stages] of the deployment.

Your intent should look something like this:

```toml
configType = "standard"
l1ChainID = 11155420
fundDevAccounts = false
useInterop = false
l1ContractsLocator = "tag://op-contracts/v1.8.0-rc.4"
l2ContractsLocator = "tag://op-contracts/v1.7.0-beta.1+l2-contracts"

```

Before you can use your intent file for a deployment, you will need to update all zero values to whatever is
appropriate for your chain. For dev environments, it is ok to use all EOAs/hot-wallets.

## Production Setup
In production environments, you should use a more secure setup with cold-wallet multisigs (e.g. Gnosis Safes) for the following:
* `baseFeeVaultRecipient`
* `l1FeeVaultRecipient`
* `sequencerFeeVaultRecipient`
* `l1ProxyAdminOwner`
* `l2ProxyAdminOwner`
* `systemConfigOwner`

HSMs (hardware security modules) are recommended for the following hot-wallets:
* `unsafeBlockSigner`
* `batcher`
* `proposer`
* `challenger`
