The OP Stack is a flexible platform with various configuration values that you can tweak to fit your specific needs. If youâ€™re looking to fine-tune your deployment, look no further.

::: warning ðŸš§ Work in Progress

OP Stack configuration is an active work in progress and will likely evolve significantly as time goes on. If something isnâ€™t working about your configuration, check back with this page to see if anything has changed.

:::

## New Blockchain Configuration

New OP Stack blockchains are currently configured with a JSON file inside the Optimism repository. The file is `<optimism repository>/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/<chain name>.json`. For example, [this is the configuration file for the tutorial blockchain](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/getting-started.json).


### Admin accounts

| Key | Type | Description | Default / Recommended value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `finalSystemOwner` | L1 Address | Address that will own all ownable contracts on L1 once the deployment is finished, including the `ProxyAdmin` contract. | It is recommended to have a single admin account to retain a common security model. |
| `controller` | L1 Address | Address that will own the `SystemDictator` contract and can therefore control the flow of the deployment or upgrade.  | It is recommended to have a single admin account to retain a common security model. |
| `proxyAdminOwner` | L2 Address | Address that will own the `ProxyAdmin` contract on L2. The L2 `ProxyAdmin` contract owns all of the `Proxy` contracts for every predeployed contract in the range `0x42...0000` to `0x42..2048`. This makes predeployed contracts easily upgradeable. | It is recommended to have a single admin account to retain a common security model. |


### Fee recipients

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baseFeeVaultRecipient` | L1 or L2 Address | Address that the base fees from all transactions on the L2 can be withdrawn to. | It is recommended to have a single admin account to retain a common security model. |
| `l1FeeVaultRecipient` | L1 or L2 Address | Address that the L1 data fees from all transactions on the L2 can be withdrawn to. | It is recommended to have a single admin account to retain a common security model. |
| `sequencerFeeVaultRecipient` | L1 or L2 Address | Address that the tip fees from all transactions on the L2 can be withdrawn to. | It is recommended to have a single admin account to retain a common security model. |

### Minimum Fee Withdrawal Amounts

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |

### Withdrawal Network

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `sequencerWindowSize` | Number of blocks | Maximum number of L1 blocks that a Sequencer can wait to incorporate the information in a specific L1 block. For example, if the window is `10` then the information in L1 block `n` must be incorporated by L1 block `n+10`. | 3600 (12 hours) |
| `channelTimeout` | Number of blocks | Maximum number of L1 blocks that a transaction channel frame can be considered valid. A transaction channel frame is a chunk of a compressed batch of transactions. After the timeout, the frame is dropped. | 300 (1 hour) |

| `batchSenderAddress` | L1 Address | Address of the account that nodes will filter for when searching for Sequencer transaction batches being sent to the `batchInboxAddress`. Can be updated later via the `SystemConfig` contract on L1. | Batcher, an address for which you own the private key |


### Proposal fields

These fields apply to output root proposals.

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `l2OutputOracleStartingBlockNumber` | Number | Block number of the first OP Stack block. Typically this should be zero, but this may be non-zero for networks that have been upgraded from a legacy system (like Optimism Mainnet). Will be removed with the addition of permissionless proposals. | 0 |

These fields apply to [the EIP 1559 algorithm](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) used for the [L2 execution costs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/transaction-fees/#the-l2-execution-fee) of transactions on the blockchain.

| `eip1559Denominator` | Number | Denominator used for the [EIP1559 gas pricing mechanism on L2](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md). A larger denominator decreases the amount by which the base fee can change in a single block. | 50 | 8 |
| `eip1559Elasticity` | Number | Elasticity for the [EIP1559 gas pricing mechanism on L2](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md). A larger elasticity increases the maximum allowable gas limit per block. | 10 | 2 |
| `l2GenesisBlockGasLimit` | String | Initial block gas limit, represented as a hex string. Default is 25m, implying a 2.5m target when combined with a 10x elasticity. | 0x17D7840 |  |
